Encapsulation:
The process of grouping data members and methods into a single unit is called encapsulation.

**[Encapsulation = Data hiding + abstraction]
Hiding data behind methods, is the concept of encapsulation.

eg.
package class15Encapsulation;

public class MyAccount {
    private double balance; <<-----data hiding

    public double getBalance() { <<----- the user is not allowed to use these methods, the user is only provided with the GUI screen, and the GUI interface calls these methods. (Abstraction)
        //validate
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(double amount) {
        //validate
        this.balance += amount;
    }
}
____________________________________________________

Advantages:
1. Security
2. Enhancement
3. Maintainability and Modularity

Disadvantages:
1. Time Consuming (As the data members are private, we need to implement methods to access them and always validation is required).
2. Performance is down.
