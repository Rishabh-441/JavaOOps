abstract modifiers applicable for :
1. methods
2. class

abstract: not complete

eg.
if we don't know about implementation,
//IF A CLASS CONTAINS AT LEAST ONE ABSTRACT METHOD, THEN THE CLASS MUST ALSO BE ABSTRACT.
public abstract class Vehicle {     <------if the method is abstract then the class should also be abstract.
    //abstract method has only declaration but not implementation, child classes are responsible to provide implementation.
    public abstract int getNoOfWheels();    <-----no curly brackets
}

eg.
public abstract void m1() {};  (ERROR: ABSTRACT METHODS CAN'T HAVE A BODY)
public void m1(); (ERROR)
public abstract void m1(); (CORRECT)
public void m1() {}; (CORRECT)
