"Partially implemented classes - unimplemented methods" are declared abstract
--instantiation is not allowed for abstract classes.
--No one is allowed to create an object for an abstract class.
--no methods can be used which are present in the class.
--if a class has at least 1 abstract method, it should be declared as abstract.
--even though if a class doesn't contains any abstract methods, then also the class can be declared as abstract.
eg.
abstract class Test {
    public void m1 () {}  <--- this method has implementation, but its dummy.
    public int m2 () {}         still, we can declare our class as abstract. (eg. Adapter class)
}
**this will work fine.
-------------------------------
eg.
abstract class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t = new Test();  <---instance of an abstract class.
    }
}
** this will throw error.
